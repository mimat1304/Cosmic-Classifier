# 🌌 Cosmic Classifier

A machine learning project that classifies different types of cosmic objects based on their features. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## 🚀 Overview

The **Cosmic Classifier** analyzes a dataset of celestial objects and builds a machine learning model to classify them accurately. The project focuses on:
- Data exploration and visualization
- Preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding)
- Model building and evaluation (classification models like Random Forest, etc.)
- Making predictions on new/unseen data

## 🗂️ Project Structure

```
📁 Cosmic-Classifier
 ├── cosmic_classifier.ipynb   # Jupyter Notebook with full code and explanations
 ├── datasets/                 # Folder containing datasets (upload separately)
 └── README.md                 # Project overview and instructions
```

## 📚 Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains features representing different cosmic objects, such as stars, galaxies, and quasars. You'll find it in the `datasets/` folder once uploaded.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Cosmic-Classifier.git
   cd Cosmic-Classifier
   ```

2. **Install Python packages**
   Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open `cosmic_classifier.ipynb` and follow along!
